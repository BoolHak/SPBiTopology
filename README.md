# SPBiTopology

Author: Bilel Methnani

A personal project exploring bi-topological structures on Gaussian integers using Lean 4 and Mathlib.

## Notes

This is a personal exploration project. The code formalizes mathematical structures and proves various properties, but the broader claims about connections to computational complexity or any other results are speculative analogies rather than rigorous results. All results should be considered as exploratory and not definitive mathematical proofs.
